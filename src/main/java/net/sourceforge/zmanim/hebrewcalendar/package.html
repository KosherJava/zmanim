The package contain classes that convert between Jewish and Gregorian dates. This package is loosely based on
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/avromf">Avrom Finkelstien's</a> code refactored to fit the Zmanim API.

<h3>Design:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>JewishDate is the base class, allowing the maintainance of an instance of a Gregorian date along with the corresponding Jewish date.
		<li>JewishCalendar extends JewishDate and adds some methods related to the calendar
		<li>HebrewDateFormatter defines the basics for taking a JewishCalendar and formatting the dates.
		<li>YomiCalculator calculates the Daf Yomi for a given JewishCalendar
	</ul>

Note that there should be no circular dependencies: Formatters and Calculators depend on Dates and Calendars, but
not the other way around.
