/**
 * <p>This class extends ZmanimCalendar and provides many more <em>zmanim</em> than available in the ZmanimCalendar. The basis
 * for most <em>zmanim</em> in this class are from the <em>sefer</em> <b><a href="https://hebrewbooks.org/9765">Yisroel
 * Vehazmanim</a></b> by <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_Dovid_Harfenes">Rabbi Yisrael Dovid Harfenes</a></b>.
 * As an example of the number of different <em>zmanim</em> made available by this class, there are methods to return 18
 * different calculations for <em>alos</em> (dawn), 18 for <em>plag hamincha</em> and 29 for <em>tzais</em> available in this
 * API. The real power of this API is the ease in calculating <em>zmanim</em> that are not part of the library. The methods for
 * <em>zmanim</em> calculations not present in this class or it's superclass  {@link ZmanimCalendar} are contained in the
 * {@link AstronomicalCalendar}, the base class of the calendars in our API since they are generic methods for calculating
 * time based on degrees or time before or after {@link #getSunrise() sunrise} and {@link #getSunset() sunset} and are of interest
 * for calculation beyond <em>zmanim</em> calculations. Here are some examples.
 * <p>First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate:
 * 
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;
 * double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ
 * double longitude = -74.222; // Lakewood, NJ
 * double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters
 * // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid time zone listed in
 * // {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}
 * TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);
 * GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);
 * ComplexZmanimCalendar czc = new ComplexZmanimCalendar(location);
 * // Optionally set the date or it will default to today's date
 * czc.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
 * czc.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);</pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> For locations such as Israel where the beginning and end of daylight savings time can fluctuate from
 * year to year, if your version of Java does not have an <a href=
 * "https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/tzdata-versions.html">up to date time zone database</a>, create a
 * {@link java.util.SimpleTimeZone} with the known start and end of DST.
 * To get <em>alos</em> calculated as 14&deg; below the horizon (as calculated in the calendars published in Montreal),
 * add {@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} (90) to the 14&deg; offset to get the desired time:
 * <br><br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 *  Date alos14 = czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 14);</pre>
 * <p>
 * To get <em>mincha gedola</em> calculated based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avraham_Gombiner"
 * >Magen Avraham (MGA)</a> using a <em>shaah zmanis</em> based on the day starting
 * 16.1&deg; below the horizon (and ending 16.1&deg; after sunset) the following calculation can be used:
 * 
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * Date minchaGedola = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees() * 6.5);</pre>
 * <p>
 * or even simpler using the included convenience methods
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * Date minchaGedola = czc.getMinchaGedola(czc.getAlos16point1Degrees(), czc.getShaahZmanis16Point1Degrees());</pre>
 * <p>
 * A little more complex example would be calculating <em>zmanim</em> that rely on a <em>shaah zmanis</em> that is
 * not present in this library. While a drop more complex, it is still rather easy. An example would be to calculate
 * the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Isserlein">Trumas Hadeshen</a>'s <em>alos</em> to
 * <em>tzais</em> based <em>plag hamincha</em> as calculated in the Machzikei Hadass calendar in Manchester, England.
 * A number of this calendar's <em>zmanim</em> are calculated based on a day starting at <em>alos</em> of 12&deg; before
 * sunrise and ending at <em>tzais</em> of 7.083&deg; after sunset. Be aware that since the <em>alos</em> and <em>tzais</em>
 * do not use identical degree-based offsets, this leads to <em>chatzos</em> being at a time other than the
 * {@link #getSunTransit() solar transit} (solar midday). To calculate this <em>zman</em>, use the following steps. Note
 * that <em>plag hamincha</em> is 10.75 hours after the start of the day, and the following steps are all that it takes.
 * <br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * Date plag = czc.getPlagHamincha(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),
 * 				czc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));</pre>
 * <p>
 * Something a drop more challenging, but still simple, would be calculating a <em>zman</em> using the same "complex"
 * offset day used in the above-mentioned Manchester calendar, but for a <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> based <em>zman</em> not
 * supported by this library, such as calculating the point that one should be <em>makpid</em>
 * not to eat on <em>erev Shabbos</em> or <em>erev Yom Tov</em>. This is 9 <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> into the day.
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Calculate the <em>shaah zmanis</em> in milliseconds for this day</li>
 * 	<li>Add 9 of these <em>shaos zmaniyos</em> to <em>alos</em> starting at 12&deg;</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * long shaahZmanis = czc.getTemporalHour(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),
 * 						czc.getSunsetOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + ZENITH_7_POINT_083));
 * Date sofZmanAchila = getTimeOffset(czc.getSunriseOffsetByDegrees({@link AstronomicalCalendar#GEOMETRIC_ZENITH} + 12),
 * 					shaahZmanis * 9);</pre>
 * <p>
 * Calculating this <em>sof zman achila</em> according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon">GRA</a>
 * is simplicity itself.
 * <pre style="background: #FEF0C9; display: inline-block;">
 * Date sofZmanAchila = czc.getTimeOffset(czc.getSunrise(), czc.getShaahZmanisGra() * 9);</pre>

	 * Hatanya's Seder Hachnasas Shabbos</a>. From an elevation of 546 meters, the top of <a href=

	 * Rabbi Levine, including Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Feigelstock who calculates it as the degrees below the horizon 4 minutes after
	 * sunset in Yerushalayim (on the equinox). That is brought down as 1.583&deg;. This is identical to the 1&deg; 35' <em>zman</em>
	 * and is probably a typo and should be 1.683&deg;. These calculations are used by most <a href=
